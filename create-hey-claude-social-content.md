# Create Hey Claude Social Media Content

This command creates a week's worth of social media content to promote a Hey Claude Substack post across LinkedIn, Substack Notes, and Bluesky.

---

## Strategy & Context

### Why This Approach

**LinkedIn** (2-3 posts/week)
- Goal: Drive traffic to Substack (NOT grow LinkedIn following - Olena already has a solid network)
- Audience: Professional/AI/leadership network (ex-colleagues from EPAM, coaches, tech/transformation folks)
- Challenge: LinkedIn deprioritizes external links - workaround is link in first comment
- What works: Data hooks, professional reframes, vulnerability + takeaway, contrarian takes

**Substack Notes** (2-3 notes/week + daily engagement)
- Goal: Drive traffic to posts AND grow following
- Audience: Writers, creatives, neurodivergent folks already on Substack
- Critical insight: For accounts under 100 subscribers, *commenting on others' Notes* is more valuable than posting your own. Notes have long staying power (2-3 weeks).
- What works: Contrarian/challenging beliefs, emotional/inspirational, community builders

**Bluesky** (5 posts/week)
- Goal: Drive traffic to posts AND grow following
- Audience: Younger (70% under 34), tech-savvy, ex-Twitter refugees, strong neurodivergent community
- Constraint: 300 character limit (tight!)
- What works: Authenticity over virality, niche focus, meaningful engagement

### Voice & Tone Guidelines

**What Olena's voice sounds like:**
- Conversational, vulnerable, hopeful
- Self-deprecating humor
- Honest and mid-thought (not polished conclusions)
- Personal ADHD stories connected to practical insights
- How she'd actually say it to a friend

**AVOID (formulaic patterns that feel manufactured):**
- Rhetorical question hooks ("The real reason?", "Want to know why?")
- Before/after templates ("I used to... Then I started...")
- Labels ("Hot take:", "Unpopular opinion:", "Thread:")
- Manufactured punchiness
- Generic inspirational language

**EMBRACE:**
- Mid-thought observations
- Incomplete sentences if that's how the thought lands
- Specific details from her actual experience
- Questions that invite real conversation
- Her actual vocabulary and rhythm

## Task Overview

You will create promotional content for a published post through the following steps:
1. **Identify the post** - Get post details from Notion, read full content
2. **Create Bluesky posts** (5 posts for the week)
3. **Create Substack Notes** (3 notes for the week)
4. **Create LinkedIn posts** (2 posts, optionally 3)
5. **Create daily Notion tasks** with copy-paste ready content

**IMPORTANT:** Work through ONE platform at a time. Don't present all content at once - it's overwhelming.

---

## Step 1: Identify the Post

**Ask the user:**
- Which post to promote (title or most recent)
- What is the publish date (to align the weekly schedule)

**Query Notion** (`2a908620-e1b0-80fd-866d-ea04d0ba0a84`) to get:
- Post title
- Post URL (Link field)
- Draft Link (for reading content before publication)
- Published date

**Read the post content** via WebFetch using the **Draft Link** (not the published URL). The draft link works before the post is published, allowing social content creation ahead of time.

---

## Step 2: Create Bluesky Posts (5 total)

**Platform specs:**
- 300 character limit (tight - every word counts)
- 2-3 hashtags recommended
- Link cards don't count toward limit, but link text does
- Younger, tech-savvy audience with strong neurodivergent community

**Hashtag strategy:**
- Standard rotation (pick 2-3): #ADHD, #AI, #Neurodivergent, #Writing, #Substack, #MentalHealth
- Add 1 custom per post as relevant (e.g., #Creativity, #ClaudeAI)

**Mix for the week:**
- 2-3 posts WITH link to the article
- 2-3 standalone posts (thought-provoking, no link)
- Keep flexible on which posts get links

**Process:**
1. Draft all 5 posts (ready to use, minimal tweaking expected)
2. Present to user for review
3. User tweaks as needed
4. **Proofread all posts** - check grammar, spelling, character count
5. Finalize

---

## Step 3: Create Substack Notes (3 total)

**Platform specs:**
- No strict character limit (can be longer, more reflective)
- Writers and neurodivergent audience
- Discovery happens through engagement more than posting
- Notes can bring subscribers 2-3 weeks after posting

**Mix for the week:**
- 1 note WITH link to the article
- 2 standalone notes (longer, more reflective)

**Process:**

For the **post-linked Note**:
1. Draft 2-3 complete options (summary style that preserves Olena's voice)
2. Present options to user
3. User picks/tweaks one
4. **Proofread** - check grammar and spelling
5. Finalize

For **standalone Notes**:
1. Identify 3-5 "most powerful/emotional/captivating fragments" from the original post
2. Explain briefly why each could work well as a standalone Note
3. User browses, pulls what resonates, shapes it themselves
4. **Proofread** - check grammar and spelling
5. Finalize

---

## Step 4: Create LinkedIn Posts (2-3 total)

**Platform specs:**
- Link in FIRST COMMENT (not in post body) - LinkedIn deprioritizes external links
- Longer posts (800-1000 words) get 26% better engagement
- Data visualizations get 36% better performance
- First 2 lines = everything (the hook determines engagement)
- First 60 minutes of engagement matter most

**Hashtag strategy:**
- 3-5 hashtags per post
- Standard rotation (pick 2-3): #ADHD, #AI, #Leadership, #ExecutiveLife, #Neurodivergent, #FutureOfWork
- Add 1-2 custom per post based on topic (e.g., #MentalHealth, #Productivity, #Burnout)

**Mix for the week:**
- Post 1 (Thursday): Data/News hook - lead with surprising stat or trend, pivot to personal take
- Post 2 (Tuesday): Personal insight/ADHD angle - lead with vulnerability, more human
- Post 3 (Monday, OPTIONAL): Carousel/Framework - only when content warrants (e.g., list, myth vs reality, framework). Can be created via Gamma app.

**Angle types to draw from:**
1. **Data/News Hook** - Start with surprising stat or recent trend, pivot to perspective
2. **Professional Reframe** - Take personal ADHD insight and frame for leaders/professionals
3. **Contrarian/Unexpected Take** - Challenge assumptions the network might have
4. **Lesson Learned** - Vulnerability + clear takeaway

**Visual options:**
- Post 1: Substack preview card
- Post 2: Midjourney image or selfie/headshot
- Post 3: Carousel via Gamma (if doing optional post)

**Link-to-comment CTA variations (rotate through - include one in each draft):**
- "the link is in the first comment👇"
- "Link in the comments 👇"
- "I wrote more about this — link in the first comment 👇"
- "Full post in the comments."
- "Link below 👇"
- "More in the first comment."

**Process (one post at a time - do NOT draft multiple posts at once):**
1. Decide angle together with user
2. Present 3 hook options for that angle
3. User selects hook
4. **Check for duplicate hooks** - ensure this hook is distinct from other LinkedIn posts this week (no similar opening lines)
5. Research relevant data/statistics if using data hook
6. Draft full post using content from the Substack post to complement the hook
7. User revises as needed
8. **Proofread thoroughly** - check grammar, spelling, flow
9. Finalize with hashtags, visual suggestion, and CTA variation
10. **Then move to next post** - repeat process

## Step 5: Create Daily Notion Tasks

**Database ID:** `2a708620-e1b0-80f9-9306-f1d6d0984dbb` (Tasks)

**Hey Claude Project ID:** `2a708620-e1b0-81df-ba5c-da0514b7f74b`

### Before creating tasks: Confirm the schedule

**Present the proposed schedule with actual dates** and ask user to confirm before creating any tasks.

Example:
```
Here's the proposed schedule for your social media content:

| Date | Day | Content |
|------|-----|---------|
| Dec 11 | Wednesday | Bluesky link post |
| Dec 12 | Thursday | LinkedIn Post 1 + Bluesky standalone |
| Dec 13 | Friday | Substack Note (with link) + 2 standalone notes + Bluesky standalone |
| Dec 16 | Monday | Substack standalone + Bluesky standalone |
| Dec 17 | Tuesday | LinkedIn Post 2 + Bluesky link post |

Does this look correct? Any dates need adjustment?
```

**Only proceed with task creation after user confirms.**

**Weekly Schedule (Wed-Tue, aligned with publish day):**

| Day | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Wednesday (publish day) | Bluesky link post |
| Thursday | LinkedIn Post 1 + Bluesky standalone |
| Friday | Substack Note (with link) + Substack standalone #1 + Bluesky standalone |
| Monday | LinkedIn Post 3 (if available) + Substack standalone #2 + Bluesky standalone |
| Tuesday | LinkedIn Post 2 + Bluesky link post |

**All tasks scheduled at 10am Central Time**

**Each task includes:**
1. Platform emoji header (📍 LinkedIn, 📝 Substack, 🦋 Bluesky)
2. Full copy-paste ready content
3. Hashtags (included in content where applicable)
4. Visual suggestion (for LinkedIn)
5. Link reminder (for LinkedIn: "Link in FIRST COMMENT: [URL]")
6. Daily engagement section (see below)

**Daily Engagement Section (include in EVERY task):**

```
