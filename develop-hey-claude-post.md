# Develop Hey Claude Post

This command takes you from a rough idea (or multiple ideas) all the way to a structured post outline — through research and conversational interview. It combines research with story extraction to surface the real post hiding inside your initial idea.

## Before Starting

Read the Hey Claude strategy file to have Jamie (the reader persona) and post guidelines fresh:
- `~/Documents/WRITING/Hey Claude/hey-claude-strategy.md`

---

## PHASE 1: Gather & Research
*Purpose: Understand what's swirling and get research context through Jamie's lens*

### Step 1: Capture the Idea(s)

Ask:
> "What's on your mind? Could be one idea, multiple angles, something half-formed, or just a vague sense that there's a post somewhere. Don't worry about having it figured out — just share what's swirling."

Let them share freely. Multiple interconnected ideas are fine.

### Step 2: Research Through Jamie's Lens

Using WebSearch, research the topic(s) through Jamie's eyes:

**Questions to guide research:**
- What would Jamie search for when struggling with this?
- What's already out there addressing this?
- Where are the gaps — what's NOT being said that Jamie needs to hear?

**Layered approach:**
1. **Specific intersection** — Search for the exact combination of topics/struggles mentioned
2. **Broader context** — Search for related struggles, adjacent problems
3. **Existing content** — What solutions are being offered? What's missing?

### Step 3: Summarize the Landscape

Present a brief summary:
- **What exists** — Main content/advice already out there
- **Where the gaps are** — What's not being said, or said differently
- **Interesting threads** — Angles that feel fresh or underexplored

**Keep this lightweight** — 5 minutes max. The research provides context, not a roadmap.

## PHASE 2: Pull the Obvious
*Purpose: Surface the real story through conversation*

**This is a conversation, not a questionnaire.** Follow the energy, not a script. The goal is to uncover layers — and the real post often isn't the one they came in with.

### Layers to Uncover

**1. Surface-level struggle/story**
- What happened? What did it look like?
- What was the experience before [the thing]?

**2. The supposed solution**
- What seemed like it would fix it?
- What changed or what did they try?

**3. Deep level / real struggle**
- What's actually underneath?
- What does this connect to?
- Where did this pattern come from?

**4. "Almost not said" moments**
- The things that feel too obvious to mention
- The things that feel too vulnerable to share
- The things that feel too small to matter
- **These are usually the most powerful**

### Key Techniques

**Follow the energy.** If something makes them pause, light up, or get quiet — go there.

**Name the turns.** When something shifts or they say something unexpected:
> "Stop. Something just happened. You just said [X]. Tell me more about that."

**Ask where the energy is.** When a new thread emerges:
> "Is the energy still in the original angle, or is it in this new thing you just discovered?"

**Reflect back exact words.** When they say something powerful, mirror it:
> "You said '[their exact phrase]' — that's the thing. Can you go deeper?"

**Watch for "too obvious."** If they say "but that's obvious" or "everyone knows that" — that's probably the gold.

**Trust the mess.** Let answers be scattered, tangential, emotional. The arc will emerge.

## PHASE 3: Structure the Fragments
*Purpose: Turn conversation fragments into a post-ready outline*

Once the real story has emerged through conversation:

### Step 1: Extract Their Exact Words

Go back through the conversation and pull out:
- Vivid sentences and phrases
- Emotional moments
- Key realizations
- Specific stories/memories

**Use their words with minimal cleaning.** The post should sound like them, not like Claude.

### Step 2: Uncover the Arc

Based on what emerged, identify the natural arc. This will be different for each post — don't force a template. Common elements might include:

- Opening scene or hook
- The pain point / struggle
- The supposed solution (if there was one)
- The twist or unexpected turn
- The deeper realization
- The roots (where this comes from)
- The invitation to Jamie

**Map their fragments to the arc** with a note for each section explaining its purpose.

### Step 3: Identify Bridges Needed

Mark places where:
- A transition is needed between sections
- More detail or expansion would help
- The user needs to write connecting tissue

### Step 4: Present the Structured Outline

Format as:

```
### SECTION [N]: [Section Name]
*Arc purpose: [What this section does in the story]*

**Their words:**
> [Exact quotes from conversation, minimally cleaned]

**Bridge needed:** [What they need to write to connect/expand]
```

End with a summary table showing sections, purposes, and status.

## PHASE 4: Handoff (Optional)

Once they have the structured outline:

> "You now have a post skeleton with your own words in place. Would you like to:
> - Take this to Ulysses and finish the draft yourself
> - Continue working on it together now
> - Run `/review-hey-claude-post` once you have a draft
> - Go straight to `/prep-hey-claude-post` when it's ready for publication"

## Important Principles

1. **Research provides context, not constraints** — The research helps spot what's fresh, but the conversation determines the post

2. **Follow the energy, not the plan** — The original idea might not be the post. That's okay. That's the point.

3. **User's words become the post** — Claude extracts and structures; Claude doesn't write the post

4. **The "almost not said" is usually the post** — The thing they hesitate to mention, dismiss as obvious, or stumble into accidentally

5. **Every arc is different** — Don't force fragments into a predetermined structure. Let the structure emerge from what they said.

6. **End with structure, not a draft** — The user finishes in their own voice

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of this process:
- User has discovered what the post is really about (which may be different from where they started)
- User has their own words organized into a clear arc
- User knows exactly what bridges they need to write
- User feels like "I just need to arrange this and I have a post"
