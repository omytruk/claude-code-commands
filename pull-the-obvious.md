# Pull the Obvious

*Original command preserved below for reference:*

This command helps surface the real story behind a Hey Claude post idea through a conversational interview process. The goal is to pull out the insights that feel "too obvious" to write about — because those are usually the most powerful.

## Why This Works

The best Hey Claude posts come from saying the thing you almost didn't say. But those insights are often invisible because they're SO natural to you. This process uses questions to externalize what's in your head — so you can see it, name it, and write about it.

## Before Starting

Read the Hey Claude strategy file to have Jamie (the reader persona) and post guidelines fresh:
- `~/Documents/WRITING/Hey Claude/hey-claude-strategy.md`

---

## The Process

**This is a conversation, not a questionnaire.** Ask one set of questions at a time, let the user answer however feels natural (messy is good), then follow the threads that emerge.

### Phase 1: Surface the Topic

Ask:
> "What do you want to write about? Could be a tool you built, something you figured out, or just a vague sense of 'there's a post here.' Don't worry about framing it — just tell me the rough idea."

Listen for: The thing they mention, but also what's underneath it.

---

### Phase 2: Before (The Struggle)

This is where the real story lives. Ask about what life was like BEFORE the thing they want to write about:

> "Before [this thing] existed — what was it like? Not the idealized version. The actual experience."

Follow-up questions to pull deeper:
- "What did it feel like to sit down and try to do [the thing]?"
- "What were you avoiding? Or dreading?"
- "Was there a specific moment — a breaking point, a frustration, an 'I can't do this anymore'?"
- "What was the physical sensation? Freezing? Spinning? Shutting down? Legs walking you somewhere else?"

**Key technique:** When they share something vivid, reflect it back and ask them to go further:
> "You said [their words]. Tell me more about that."

---

### Phase 3: The Emotional Layer

This is often where the "uncomfortable admission" lives. Ask gently:

- "Did you ever feel ashamed of needing [this thing]? Like 'why can't I just do it like a normal person'?"
- "How many times did you almost give up? Or did you actually give up for a while?"
- "What were you telling yourself during those moments?"

Listen for: Self-criticism, shame, frustration, feeling broken. These become the "Jamie feels seen" moments in the post.

---

### Phase 4: The Break (What Changed)

Find the turning point:

> "What made you finally try something different? Or what happened that broke the pattern?"

Follow-ups:
- "Was it exhaustion? Curiosity? Desperation? Accident?"
- "What specifically did you do differently?"

---

### Phase 5: The Discovery

This is the "aha" moment:

> "When [the thing] worked — what did that feel like? What was the emotion?"

Listen for: Relief, surprise, "I can do it," tears, immediate action (like hitting publish with zero hesitation).

Follow-up:
> "What did you realize in that moment about yourself or about the problem?"

---

### Phase 6: The Deeper Layer (Optional but Powerful)

If the conversation is going deep, gently probe for bigger connections:

- "Has anyone or anything ever done this for you before? Held the structure, done the remembering, made things feel less scary?"
- "Does this connect to anything bigger in your life?"

**Note:** Only go here if the user seems ready. This layer makes posts deeply resonant but requires vulnerability.

---

### Phase 7: Capture the Arc

Once the story has emerged, reflect back the full arc:

```
THE ARC:

1. THE SCENE: [The specific situation — vivid, relatable]

2. THE STRUGGLE: [What it felt like — the mountain, the avoidance, the frustration]

3. THE BREAK: [What made them try something different]

4. THE DISCOVERY: [What they realized — about the problem or themselves]

5. THE SHIFT: [The moment it worked — how long it took, what changed]

6. THE FEELING: [The emotional payoff — relief, "I can do it," tears, immediate action]

7. THE DEEPER LAYER: [If present — the bigger connection]

8. THE INVITATION TO JAMIE: [Not "here's my system" but "this exists, you're not broken, maybe you can feel this too"]
```

Ask:
> "Does this feel like the post you want to write? The real one?"

---

## Key Techniques

**Reflect back their exact words.** When they say something powerful, quote it back:
> "You said '[their exact phrase]' — that's huge. Can you tell me more?"

**Follow the energy.** If something makes them pause, go deeper. If something makes them light up, go deeper. If something makes them tear up, go WAY deeper.

**Don't lead.** Ask "what did that feel like?" not "did that feel like relief?" Let them find their own words.

**Trust the mess.** The best insights come from stream-of-consciousness answers. Don't try to organize prematurely.

**Watch for "too obvious."** If they say "but that's obvious" or "everyone knows that" — that's probably the gold. Ask them to say more.

## What You're Looking For

The post isn't about the tool or the system. The post is about:
- The struggle that "should be simple" but isn't
- The moment of breaking through
- The feeling of "I can do it"
- The invitation to Jamie: someone like you already did this

---

## After the Interview

Once the arc is captured:
1. Suggest a working title (usually from a vivid phrase in Phase 2)
2. Ask if they want to start drafting now or save this for later
3. Remind them: the messy interview IS the first draft — they just need to arrange it

## Example Questions Bank

**Opening:**
- "What's pulling you to write about this?"
- "When did you first realize this could be a post?"

**Struggle:**
- "What was the worst part?"
- "How long did this go on before something changed?"
- "What did you try that didn't work?"

**Emotional:**
- "What were you afraid of?"
- "What did you tell yourself about why you couldn't do it?"
- "Did anyone else know you were struggling with this?"

**Breakthrough:**
- "What surprised you about how it worked?"
- "How fast did it happen once it clicked?"
- "What did you do immediately after?"

**Deeper:**
- "Why do you think this hit you so hard?"
- "What does this make possible that wasn't before?"

*Remember: The goal is "I can do it" — for both the writer and for Jamie reading the post.*
