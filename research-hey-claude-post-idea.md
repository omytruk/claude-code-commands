## Workflow

### Step 1: Capture the Post Idea

Ask the user:
> "What's your post idea? Just give me the rough concept."

Capture whatever they say - don't try to refine it yet.

---

### Step 2: Identify Target Persona(s)

Present the persona list and ask:
> "Who is this post for? Pick your primary persona and any sub-personas that apply."

Show the list above and let them choose. Examples:
- "ADHD"
- "Writers + Substack"
- "Writers + Book Writers + ADHD"

---

### Step 3: Layered Research

**Use WebSearch to find real struggles and questions from the target audience.**

### Layer 1: Specific Intersection (Most Relevant)

If multiple personas are selected, search for their EXACT intersection first:
- Search query examples:
  - `"ADHD Substack writer" struggles site:reddit.com`
  - `"ADHD book writer" challenges productivity`
  - `"ADHD artist" creative block organization`

Look for:
- Real struggles people describe
- Questions they ask
- Frustrations they express
- Solutions they've tried that didn't work

**Report 2-3 specific struggles from this intersection** (if found).

### Layer 2: Topic + Persona (Broader Context)

Take the POST TOPIC and combine with each persona separately:
- If post is about "organizing research notes" and personas are Writers + Book Writers + ADHD:
  - Search: `"organizing research notes" ADHD`
  - Search: `"book research organization" writer`
  - Search: `"research notes" overwhelmed writer`

**Report 2-3 additional relevant struggles** that connect to the post topic.

### Layer 3: Keywords for SEO (Quick Scan)

Note any recurring phrases or terms people use when discussing this topic:
- How do they describe the problem?
- What words do they search for?
- What solutions are they've looking for?

**List 3-5 keywords/phrases** to consider weaving into the post.

---

### Step 4: Validation & Angle Check

Based on the research, provide:

**1. Validation:**
- Does the post idea address a real struggle people have? (Yes/Maybe/Needs pivot)
- How urgent/painful is this problem for the audience?

**2. Angle Suggestions:**
- Is there a specific angle that would resonate more based on the research?
- Any "aha" moments from the research that could strengthen the post?

**3. "Why This Works for [Persona]" Hook:**
- Suggest 1-2 sentences that could explain why this solution specifically works for the target persona
- Example: "Why this works for ADHD brains: It removes the decision fatigue of [X] by [Y]"

---

### Step 5: Quick Summary

Provide a concise summary:

```
POST IDEA: [their original idea]
TARGET: [personas selected]
VALIDATED: [Yes/Maybe/Needs pivot]

KEY STRUGGLES FOUND:
1. [struggle]

## Important Notes

- **Keep it lightweight** - This should take 5-10 minutes max
- **Don't overwhelm** - 2-3 struggles per layer is enough
- **Real voices matter** - Quote or paraphrase actual Reddit/forum posts when possible
- **No rabbit holes** - If search doesn't find much for Layer 1, that's fine - move to Layer 2
- **Conversational** - This is a collaborative brainstorm, not a formal report
- **Trust the process** - Even "no results" is useful data (maybe the intersection is too niche)
