# Review Hey Claude Post

This command reviews a draft Hey Claude post against Jamie (the reader persona) and the "What Hey Claude is NOT" guidelines before moving to publication prep.

## When to Use

After writing a draft, before running `/prep-hey-claude-post`. This is your quality gate to ensure the post lands for Jamie.

## Before Starting

Read the Hey Claude strategy file for full context on Jamie and guidelines:
- `~/Documents/WRITING/Hey Claude/hey-claude-strategy.md`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get the Draft

Ask:
> "Where's your draft? Give me the Ulysses document name or paste the content."

**If Ulysses:** Navigate to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/X5AZV975AG~com~soulmen~ulysses3/Documents/Projects/326364fcbab7438fabb5ce008d2e6f33-ulproject/` and find the document.

**If pasted:** Work with what they provide.

Read the full draft before proceeding.

---

### Step 2: Jamie Gut-Check

Review the draft against these four questions. For each one, provide a brief assessment (1-2 sentences):

**1. Would Jamie feel SEEN by the opening?**
- Does it name a struggle Jamie has experienced?
- Is it personal and specific, not generic?
- Would Jamie think "oh, this is about me" in the first few lines?

**2. Would Jamie understand this without Googling anything?**
- Is there jargon that needs explaining?
- Are technical concepts shown through story rather than defined?
- Would someone who's never used Claude Code still follow along?

**3. Is there something Jamie can try in under 5 minutes?**
- Is there a practical takeaway?
- Is it copy-paste ready or clearly actionable?
- Does it feel accessible, not overwhelming?

**4. Does Jamie leave thinking "I can do it"?**
- Does the post end with possibility, not homework?
- Is the transformation clear — from "I can't" to "I can"?
- Does it feel like permission, not instruction?

### Step 3: "What Hey Claude is NOT" Check

Flag if any of these are creeping in:

| Check | Warning Signs |
|-------|---------------|
| **Tutorial creep** | Step-by-step instructions dominate; story is just a wrapper |
| **Neurotypical productivity** | Assumes discipline/willpower; doesn't acknowledge ADHD struggles |
| **AI hype** | "AI will change everything!" without grounding in real experience |
| **AI fear** | Defensive about AI use; over-explaining why it's okay |
| **Listicle in disguise** | "5 ways to..." or "Here's what I learned..." as the structure |
| **Science explainer** | Leading with research/neuroscience instead of personal story |

For each that applies, note specifically where it happens and suggest how to refocus.

---

### Step 4: Verdict

Based on the above, provide ONE of these:

**✅ Ready for `/prep-hey-claude-post`**
> "This lands for Jamie. The opening is strong, the story carries the tool, and Jamie will leave feeling 'I can do it.' Ready to prep for publication."

**⚠️ Minor adjustments suggested**
> "Almost there. A few tweaks will make this land better for Jamie:"
> - [Specific suggestion 1]
> - [Specific suggestion 2]
>
> "Want to make these changes, or should we talk through them?"

**🔄 Needs rework**
> "The bones are here, but this isn't landing for Jamie yet. Here's what's getting in the way:"
> - [Specific issue 1 — what's happening and why it doesn't work]
> - [Specific issue 2]
>
> "Do you want to talk through how to refocus this?"

---

### Step 5: Transition to Prep (If Ready)

If verdict is ✅ or ⚠️ with changes made, ask:

> "Ready to run `/prep-hey-claude-post`? This will handle proofreading, SEO, feature image, cross-linking, and Notion."

If they say yes, remind them to run the command (or run it if you can chain commands).

## Tone for This Review

- **Honest but supportive** — Don't sugarcoat, but don't be harsh
- **Specific** — Point to exact lines or sections, not vague feedback
- **Jamie-focused** — Frame everything in terms of "would Jamie..."
- **Quick** — This should take 5-10 minutes, not a deep editing session

## Quick Reference: Jamie in 30 Seconds

- ADHD creative, late 30s-40s
- Has a "project junkyard" of half-finished things
- Thinks technical AI stuff "isn't for them"
- Tired of picking one box
- Arrives: "I can't" → Leaves: "I can do it"
