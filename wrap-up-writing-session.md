# Wrap Up Writing Session

End a book writing session by capturing progress and preparing for the next session.

## Instructions

1. **Review what was accomplished this session**:
   - What scenes/sections were written or edited
   - Key breakthroughs or insights
   - Word count progress (if significant)

2. **Identify what's next**:
   - Specific next writing task (not vague)
   - Any research needed before next session
   - Scenes that need attention

3. **Update the book state file**:
   - Location: `~/Documents/WRITING/Book State/agents-of-impossible-state.md`
   - Create the directory if it doesn't exist
   - Overwrite with current state (this is a living document, not a log)

4. **State file structure** (see existing file for full format):
   - **Complete Book Structure**: All parts and chapters with synopses and status
   - **Current Chapter Detailed Status**: Scene-by-scene breakdown with proposed order
   - **Scenes to Move**: Table of scenes that belong in other chapters
   - **Remaining Work**: Specific tasks with research questions
   - **What We Accomplished**: This session's concrete progress
   - **Coaching Notes**: What worked, research approach, writing style preferences
   - **The Framework**: Quick reference for the book's core concept

5. **Update synopses as needed**:
   - If chapter focus or direction changed, update the synopsis
   - If new chapters or structure changes, reflect them

6. **Offer to create tasks/reminders**:
   - Ask if user wants a Notion reminder for next writing session
   - Ask if anything needs to be brain-dumped before closing

7. **End with encouragement** (genuine, not fluffy):
   - Acknowledge specific progress made
   - Name the next concrete thing they'll do
